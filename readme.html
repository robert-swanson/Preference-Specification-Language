**Project - Domain-Specific Language**

<!--

General
========

For each of your team's implementations, explain the following (where appropriate and applicable):

- details on calling conventions, input and output data formats, limitations, bugs, and special features.
- negative aspects of your program (limitations, known bugs)
- positive aspects (extensions, special features)
- describe your choice of modularization (abstractions), data structures, and algorithms
- explain anything you did that is likely to be different from what other students may have done
- justify any design decisions for which the rationale isn't immediately clear

Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.

Project Selection
=================
Define the Domain
------------------
College course recomendation based off of degree requirements and student preferences.
The end goal is to make a language that can specify user preferences for Envisage.

<!--(What is the purpose of the language?) -->
Define the Problem
------------------
How does the user express the requirements of their degree and their personal preferences to the planning engine?
There is a lot to think about when creating a plan, and all the moving parts can be overwhelming, which is what this language will strive to help.


<!-- Create example "solutions". What is the expected output for some examples of valid input? -->
Expected Solutions
------------------
The input would be a `.psl` file that specifies user preferences and degree requirements in a human readable format.
(We renamed the type of file from `.cps` to `.psl`, Preference Specification Language, on 3.13.21)
For example, the following file describes a few requirements and then specifies a few user preferences
~~~~
definitions {
    priority strongly 10.
    priority moderately 5.
    priority slightly 1.
}

computerScienceBSRequirements {
    require "COS 102".
    require not "COS 103".
    require "COS 120".
    require "COS 121", "COS 333".

    require 1 of "COS 311", "COS 321".
    require 2 of "COS 381", "COS 421", "COS 436".

    require 128 hours in plan.
    require 42 upper division credits.

    require taking "COS 120" before "COS 121".
}

studentPreferences {
    prefer moderately "COS 999".
    prefer moderately later classes.

    if taking "COS 436" then {
        prefer slightly "COS 381".
        prefer slightly not  "COS 421".
    } otherwise {
        prefer slightly not  "COS 421".
    }

    when taking "COS 381" {
        prefer moderately less credits in semester.
    }

    when (taking "COS 381" and taking "COS 333") {
        prefer moderately less credits in semester.
    }

    when ((taking "COS 381" or taking "MAT 215") and taking "COS 121") {
        prefer moderately less credits in semester.
    }

    when (taking "COS 381" or (taking "MAT 215" and taking "COS 121")) {
        prefer moderately less credits in semester.
    }

    require "COS 121".
    require not "COS 121".
    prefer moderately "COS 121".
}
~~~~
[Example `good-integrated.psl`]

The output would be a python file which includes a python function for each requirement, which takes in the context of a plan and returns some value corresponding to that requirement's satisfaction.
Other possible outputs could be a prolog fact file or a json document.
This output file would probably not be of much use to the user without other tools to create or pass in plans.

[Example `output.py`]
The compiler could create a python file like this, which could take in a python object (which could be provided and decoded from JSON) and can specify whether the plan is valid, and also the level to which the user preferences are met.
This file includes the `helpers.py` file which **is not generated** and provides basic functionality that supports preference and requiremnt validation.

<!-- Define functionality. How is the output determined for a given input? -->
Define Functionality
------------------
A person making use of this system would start by creating a `.psl` input file that follows the language specification to define the requirements of their degrees (possibly by importing from other files).
They would then run the compiler which would produce a python file with two functions:
1. `isValidPlan(plan)` which returns a boolean
2. `planScore(plan)` which returns a double between 0 and 1, with 1 being the highest possible score, which can only be achived when all applied preferences are fully met (which is not possible for preferences which use a sigmoid function).
The user could populate a python object however they wish, but would likely do so by specifying a candidate plan in json, and then decoding it.
They could then pass this object to either function to evaluate it.

<!-- Talk with the professor, and get approval. -->
Approval
------------------
We talked to Dr. Denning about the difference between syntactic and semantic analysis and added a few types of symantic errors that we will check including

1. Verify counts for things such as `require 7 of "COS 381", "COS 421", "COS 436".`
2. Ensure that there are no prerequisite cycles.
~~~~
require "A" before "B".
require "B" before "A".
~~~~
3. Identify preference/requirement conflicts when two constrain the same thing differently, for example
~~~~
	require "COS 121".
	require not "COS 121".
	prefer moderately "COS 121".
~~~~


Splitting Up the Work
------------------
Rob made example input and output, and contributed to the readme.

Liz made the template README and filled out initial stuff and discussed semantic vs syntactic examples.

Testing the Grammar
------------------
As we wrote out the grammar, we realized that there were several changes that needed to be made for parsing ease / usability.

1. we changed the `:` after a block name to `{ body }`.
2. We added `otherwise` as an option in addition to the `if` statements.
3. We added boolean logic to conditionals and forced parentheses around uses of `and` and `or` to make order of operations explicit.
4. We also fleshed out that the conditions for if statements might be and all the potential constraints for what might follow the `require` keyword.

These changes are reflected in the input listed in Project Selection.

We used the Definitive ANTLR 4 Reference book to implement strings, page 76.


Testing the Parser
------------------
<!--list correct and incorrect inputs-->
We made several good and bad input files.

Good Inputs: For the sake of space, I will just show the good output of `good-integrated.psl`, which
combines a lot of potential inputs.

![A screenshot showing the unsuccessful parsing of bad-string.psl](images/bad-string.png width="600px")

Splitting Up the Work
------------------
We did most of the main work of creating/fixing the grammar together.

Rob worked on a bit of the grammar on his own and made multiple correct and incorrect inputs.

Liz worked on the readme, generated the parser, and set up a java class to run inputs.

Translator
======================
Translator
------------------
We chose to use a listener instead of a visitor for this translation.

The translator supports the following features:

- conditions
    - course inclusion
    - n course inclusion
    - upper division hours
    - number of credits in total semester
    - taking left before right (to a degree, it currently only works with one class as the prerequisite)
- priority aliasing (this is the main aspect of semantic analysis for this milestone)

Our translator generates a python file that is then used to evaluate a plan to see if it conforms to the
student's requirements and preferences. Here is the file when `good-integrated.psl` is passed to the translator.
~~~~

    if validator.isValid:
        print("Valid Plan")
    else:
        print("Invalid Plan")

def scorePlan():
    scorer = Scorer()
    scorer.enableDiagnostics()

    print("Final Score: {:.0f}%".format(scorer.getScore()))

Testing the Translator
------------------
When writing prefer statements, you must use a predefined priority strength.
When passing in:
~~~~
definitions {
    priority strongly 10.
    priority moderately 5.
    priority slightly 1.
}
...
studentPreferences {
    prefer moderately "COS 999".
    ...
}
~~~~
[Excerpt from good-integrated.psl]

the translator successfully generates:
![A screenshot showing the successful generation of `prefer moderately "COS 999".`. Note the 5 being passed in
as the preference weight](images/generatedPy.png width="600px")

However, when given:
~~~~
definitions {
    priority strongly 10.
    priority moderately 5.
    priority slightly 1.
}
...
studentPreferences {
    prefer somewhat "COS 999".
...
}
~~~~
[Corrupted excerpt from good-integrated.psl]

the translator prints an error and exits the program:

![A screenshot showing the result of incorrect input.](images/badPreference.png width="600px")

To test the generated python and validate its correctness, we made the scoring process describe the logic behind its validation and its scoring.
We were then able to run the compiler on our test input, run the generated code with our test plan, and check its output to verify correct plan assessment.

![A screenshot showing the diagnostic output produced by the generated python](images/generated-output-diagnostics.png width="600px")

The test plan that we evaluated is included in the submission.

Changes to Grammar
------------------
While working on this stage of the project, we realized that there were many things we needed to change in the grammar.

- changes
    - you no longer include `taking` when saying `require taking "COS 123".`
    - the ability to negate a statement got moved to a different rule to make it easier to translate
    - changed the generic `constraint` (which could be a required or a prefer statement) to distinguish between the two as `rConstraint` and `pConstraint`
    - added the ability to specify whether you want certain constraints to apply to a whole plan or a specific semester

Splitting Up the Work
------------------
Liz worked heavily with the listener and the readme. She also worked with Rob on some of the plan evaluators.

Rob worked more hours because he is also working on this project for his Research 1 class.
He spent time building a robust API both for the python evaluation helpers and the python generation code.
He created multiple scoring functions that could be supplied customizable hard and soft bounds, which could either resemble linear scoring or optimal style scoring.
He implemented the python generating API in java such that `Constraint` objects could be created by the listener, and the `.require()` or `.prefer(weight)` functions could be called on them, and they would be conveniently added to the generated file.

Documentation
======================
Documentation
--------------
See `documentation.html`

Example & Validation
--------------
For a non-trivial example, Liz made a json version of her 4-year plan. It's not 100% accurate, but it's close enough to
be a good example for this project.

DSL vs GPL/Manual
--------------
This DSL is helpful because it allows non-programmers to be able to use it without having to learn too much about coding.
Our purpose could certainly be accomplished with many other languages, but those other languages contain a lot of extra
and unnecessary functionality that could bog down the user. Our DSL narrows down the information needed to be able to use
it to the bare minimum, meaning that it is easier for a non-coder to use than a different language. Our DSL is also better
than checking a plan by hand because it minimizes the tedium and makes some things much faster to do. For example, the total number
of credits in a plan is obviously able to be computed by hand, but it would take a long time, while it is very easy to write code
that computes this number for the user.

Additional Functionality
--------------
During this milestone we added some more functionality:
 - you can negate a requirement or preference (`require not "COS 121"`)
 - nearly all the prefer statements work; `prefer less/more classes/credits in semester/plan` assumes the plan handed in is just one semester<!--    - there is a little bit of weirdness, see note-->

Splitting Up the Work
------------------
Liz wrote DSL vs GPL/Manual, created the non-trivial example, and added the functionality mentioned above.
Rob wrote Documentation and verified the results of the example.

The breakdown of work throughout the project can be seen at the end of each previous milestone.
