**Project - Domain-Specific Language**

<!--

General
========

For each of your team's implementations, explain the following (where appropriate and applicable):

- details on calling conventions, input and output data formats, limitations, bugs, and special features.
- negative aspects of your program (limitations, known bugs)
- positive aspects (extensions, special features)
- describe your choice of modularization (abstractions), data structures, and algorithms
- explain anything you did that is likely to be different from what other students may have done
- justify any design decisions for which the rationale isn't immediately clear

Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.

A Few Markdeep Examples
========================

I have left some examples below to demonstrate how you can format your write-up using Markdeep.
For more details, see [http://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html](http://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html).
Remove this section from your final submission :)


Below is a "Hello, World!" Python program.
You can include code (`x = 2`) in your sentences, too!

~~~~
#!/usr/bin/python

print("Hello, World!")
~~~~

Below is a screenshot showing me running the program above.

![A screenshot showing Python running a "Hello, World!" program.](screenshot.png width="600px")

Note: included images need to be included along with the `readme.html` file.


You can even include math ($x = 2$) in your readme.
For larger equations, use double dollar signs!

$$ f(x) = \sum_{x=0}^{100} \frac{x^2 + 1}{2x + 1} $$
