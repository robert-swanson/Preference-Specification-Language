**A00 - Comparing Languages**

This is a sample write up for the A00_LanguageComparison assignment.


<!--

General
========

For each of your team's implementations, explain the following (where appropriate and applicable):

- details on calling conventions, input and output data formats, limitations, bugs, and special features.
- negative aspects of your program (limitations, known bugs)
- positive aspects (extensions, special features)
- describe your choice of modularization (abstractions), data structures, and algorithms
- explain anything you did that is likely to be different from what other students may have done
- justify any design decisions for which the rationale isn't immediately clear

Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.


Submission
-----------


Create a zip file that contains all of your code, this `readme.html` document, and any additional files of evidence (ex: screenshots).

Use folders to divide up the subparts of your submission.
For example, your zip file could look like the following:

~~~~
readme.html
ada/
    primepartitions.adb
    screenshot.png
go/
    primepartitions.go
    screenshot.png
haskell/
    primepartitions.hs
    screenshot.png
prolog/
    primepartitions.pl
    screenshot.png
python/
    primepartitions.py

<!--
How do the languages compare to one another?
Which language was your favorite?  Which was your least favorite?
What type of problems would each language be good at solving?
When you had a choice of language, why did you decide on the language in which you implemented your solution?
If you worked with a partnor, how did you decide to split up the work?

List any other comments below.
Feel free to provide any feedback on how much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed doing it.

A Few Markdeep Examples
========================

I have left some examples below to demonstrate how you can format your write-up using Markdeep.
For more details, see [http://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html](http://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html).
Remove this section from your final submission :)


Below is a "Hello, World!" Python program.
You can include code (`x = 2`) in your sentences, too!

~~~~
#!/usr/bin/python

print("Hello, World!")
~~~~

Below is a screenshot showing me running the program above.

![A screenshot showing Python running a "Hello, World!" program.](screenshot.png width="600px")

Note: included images need to be included along with the `readme.html` file.


You can even include math ($x = 2$) in your readme.
For larger equations, use double dollar signs!

$$ f(x) = \sum_{x=0}^{100} \frac{x^2 + 1}{2x + 1} $$
